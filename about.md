Hi, I am Yash Uperia. I am currently a Final Year Medical student from India. I like the field of medicine a lot, but outside of medicine I enjoy learning about science and technology, easy cooking, programming, astronomy, different cultures, fiction books and more. I love to research and experiment about how to make our tasks/lives more efficient. I have started this blog to share the experience which I gain as I advance in my life. Hope you will find it useful and Interestig.

Will be happy to receive your **emails** at [boredmedico@gmail.com]()!

You can **tweet** at me at [@yashuperia]()
