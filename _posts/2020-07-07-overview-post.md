After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. -- Matthew 6:9

A wonderful weekend so far. It's been sunny and warm (for February in New York anyway, at 50-55F) and I've been spending as much time as humanly possible outside. Yesterday me, Liz, and a couple of friends staying with us took both dogs to Mount Prospect Park, and Flurry got herself maximally dirty snuffling around and rolling in some mud. A great time was had by all. Today, Ellie and I went to church together in the morning, then parted ways so I could attend a meeting of the Stewardship Committee, which is concerned with making sure the church can afford to exist. After that I came home and took Flurry on a trip to another park near our house. It was a very peaceful, sort of meditative day; a lot of being outside and being social, interspersed with rereading an old fanfic I love.

I had dinner with my parents and my younger brother on Saturday night, and my dad reminded me that he's been diligently journaling every trip we took together as a family since I was little. He also reminded me that he's been working on a family history, which apparently runs to nearly 150 pages now (!). Today at church, there was a reading adapted from Antoine de St. Exupery, which I'll just blockquote:

Let us bring up our children. It is not the place of some official to hand to them their heritage. If others impart to our children our knowledge and ideals, they will lose all of us that is wordless and full of wonder. Let us build memories in our children, lest they allow treasures to be lost because they have not been given the keys. We live, not by things, but by the meanings of things. It is needful to transmit the passwords from generation to generation. -- Antoine de St. Exupery

I found this very powerful and moving. Sometimes I think about the idea of looking backwards through the past, up the long long line of all the people that not only existed but passed down their stories and ideals and dreams so that I, too, could exist, and I tear up thinking about it. The fact that my dad actually has been making a map of this imagined country of the past is even more moving still, since I can not only imagine it, but actually read back into it. I can know the names and the days of people hundreds of years removed from me, but who nonetheless are still part of me.

{: data-content="footnotes"}

[^1]: this is a footnote. It should highlight if you click on the corresponding superscript number.
[^2]: hey there, i'm using no style please!
[^3]: this is another footnote.
[^4]: this is a very very long footnote to test if a very very long footnote brings some problems or not. I strongly hope that there are no problems but you know sometimes problems arise from nowhere.
