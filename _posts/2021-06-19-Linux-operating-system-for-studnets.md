### Why use linux os as a student?

1. Linux is **free** OS, Downloading and installing it on your computer doesn't require a licence or activation key. And most applications on linux are open-source with no fees/charges and they are as good as and sometimes better than paid ones on other OS.
So as a student when you may not be able to afford the latest and greatest computer,  you can use an old computer with linux on it. Or purchase very budget friendly computer without OS and use linux on it!.
2. It is **VERY STABLE** OS. As a student, you want a computer that just works without much maintenance. You don't Have to waste your time keeping your OS clean and healthy, you can use that time to concentrate on your study or work. Unlike windows on which you have to wait for completing updates during shutdown and startup, Linux OS allows you to update the system if or whenever you like to update. system update occurs via simple commands and doesn't interrupt your workflow. You will find the system as it is months or years after if you don't update.
3. **No. Ads, Malwares** There are almost none chances of ads, malware, ransomware on Linux. These occur frequently on windows if you are not careful. Almost all of us have encountered that unknown extension that gets installed on our Chrome browser and doesn't go away, that never happens on Linux.
4. **Easy to use**. If you know android you will like Linux very much. In fact, Android OS is derived from Linux. It is simple to use, with understandable settings, and less clutter (bloatware). Most of the distributions come with essential tools pre-installed. like Video player, Office apps, PDF reader, music player, calculator, etc. You won't have to download much.

5. **Customizability** Linux is available as different distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, ElementaryOS, KDE-Neon, ArchLinux, and many more. You can choose from any one of these as per your taste and requirements. for example;
    - Ubuntu: if you want complete well-rounded os
    - ElementaryOS: if you want a simple yet modern (macbook like) interface yet powerful base of Ubuntu
    - Manjaro: latest applications with easy to use interface
    - ArchLinux: if you want total control over what you want to install on your computer, which often yields faster speeds and more stability.
In all distributions you can apply themes according to your vibe
6. **Runs fast on Old hardware** RAM and Storage requirements of Linux are minimum, and it runs decently on even very old hardware. You can revive your old, slow, laggy computer with linux to do basic computing on it (pdf, office, web-browsing, file management, etc).
7. **You will learn command line** As you will use linux you will learn very useful skills like working with command-line-interface if you are not from a computer science background. CLI is very efficient and fast and once you learn it you won't go back to the graphical interface for many tasks. You can also learn some basic programming on it if you want to.

In conclusion, I would say if you don't have any specific requirements like adobe acrobat, proprietary software, professional photo/video editing (you can do basic editing via free software) and you just want a stable hassle-free OS for basic tasks and you are willing to learn some simple command line you can use linux as your daily driver.
