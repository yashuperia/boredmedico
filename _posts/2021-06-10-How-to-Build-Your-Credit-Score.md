# HOW TO BUILD YOUR CREDIT SCORE STARTING WITH SECURED CREDIT CARDS

### Why do you need a credit score?

A good credit score makes you eligible to avail many financial services including Credit Card. More often if used responsibly these services may offer you many advantages and perks, for example, free miles for air travel, free hostel stay, discounts on gas/petrol, free launge access in many aiports.

### How to get credit card?

To have a credit card you must be eligible according to criteria decided by companies (more often banks). In North America these criterias are quite liberal, but in India banks require that you have decent regular income from job or business, and/or minimum of 750 of credit score to get a credit card. Banks will ask you to produce last salary slip from your job or income tax return copy.
After you apply, if you meet these criteria your application would be approved.

### What to do if you dont have active job or business (ie. income proof) ?

If you dont have income proof, you have to apply for secured credit card. Yes, usual credit cards are unsecured (it means bank gives you money to spend just based on your credit). But since you dont have income proof to prove your credit (no, bank statements are not accepted, and often stipends also dont count) you have to apply for Secured credit card. You have to provide security in the form of Fixed Deposit (FD). Secured credit cards are aproved instantly provided that you make FD in that bank of minimum prescribed value.
Note on Add-on card: Add-on cards (which are cards given on existing credit cards, you can get those on your parents's or friend's card ) generaly do not report credit history in your name for most Indian banks. (In other countries this might not be the case)

### What are specifications of secured credit card?

- Minimum FD amount is usualy Rs. 20,000. (for some bank as low as 10,000 for ex. ICICI bank)
- Credit limit (maximum amount you can spend in one month) : 85-90% of FD amount.
- No income proof document requied.
** You will have to cancel your card BEFORE prematurely closing FD if you wish to do so, otherwise it would negatively impact on your credit score.

Now if you can you can make FD of heigher amount for example 1 lakh rupees so you can have credit limit around Rs.85,000. This will help to keep your credit Utilisation ratio at minimum.

### How to get these secured cards?

You have to visit the respected bank branches and after making FD (in person) they will offer you options form which you can select, or you may request particular card if you want any specific card, sometimes they will give you your choice of card in secured form.

### How to bulid a good credit score?

Credit score in India ranges between 300-900. Good Credit score is considered >750. Very good is >800.

1. Make credit card bill payments on time.(before due date).
2. Keep credit utilisation ratio less than 10%
   - (credit utilisation ratio = amount spent/amount credit limit)
As the number of one time bill payments increases your score will also increase, To make this process fast, you can have two credit cards so in 1 month(credit cycle) you will have 2 bills so in 3 credit cycles you will have history of 6 payments. That will elevate your score.

3. Try to get unsecured credit card, This has a low impact on score, but in future it will be easy for you to get other cards and age of your unsecured card would increase early if you get it early. Age of account also has moderate impact on credit score.

### How to check my credit score?

Many banks or services like PayTm or Cred offers free credit score report for single time. You can use them by signing into their app or website. But if you want to check your score multiple time you have to go on credit score companey's page like CIBIL, They also offer 1 free report but after that they carge one time fee or subscription for some period. But mostly these free sources would be enough.

### What to do after you have good credit score or unsecured cards?
